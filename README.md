# PyCharm_Projects

1.) Flipkart_Login_Page 
* In this project, I created a login page similar to the Flipkart application.
* After logging in, if the correct credentials are entered, a message box appears saying "Login successful."
* Otherwise, a message box appears saying "Login unsuccessful."
  

2.) News App: This is a news application which is designed using tkinter.

* Users can initially select a country from a list to load news articles specific to that country.
* The available countries are: India, USA, Canada, China, Ukraine, Australia, Argentina, Poland, Romania, and Russia.
* Once a country is selected, the application will fetch the latest news articles for that country using an API.
* The available information for each news article includes the source, publication date and time, and the headline.
* The application includes three functionalities:
    * Navigate to the previous news article.
    * Navigate to the next news article.  
    * Read more to open the full news article in a browser.
 
3.) Wallpapers Viewer application:
* I've developed a Wallpapers Viewer application where images stored in a folder named "wallpaper" are displayed.
*  Each time the "Next" button is clicked, the next image in the sequence is loaded and shown in loop.

4.) Simple calcultor :
* â€™ve developed a simple calculator using Tkinter that correctly performs arithmetic operations.
